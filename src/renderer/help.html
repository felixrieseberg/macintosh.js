  <h2>How can I get files into the machine?</h2>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the folder "macintosh.js" in your <a href="#_" id="user_dir">user directory</a>.</li>
      <li>Put any files you want to use in your VM (virtual machine) into that folder.</li>
      <li>Restart the app.</li>
      <li>On the VM's desktop, find the "Unix" volume and double-click to open it.</li>
      <li>Find the "macintosh.js" folder, which now contains all your files.</li>
    </ul>

    Files will be copied over when you start your VM. They are not synchronized while the VM is running. However, any changes made to the "macintosh.js" folder in your VM will be saved to the corresponding folder in your home directory once you shut the VM down.

    Be chill about it: The more files you put into that folder,
    the more memory macintosh.js will consume.

  <h2>How can I get files out of the machine?</h2>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>On the VM's (virtual machine) desktop, find the "Unix" volume and double-click to open it.</li>
      <li>Find the "macintosh.js" folder.</li>
      <li>Copy any files you want to move out of your VM into that folder.</li>
      <li>Shut the VM down. The app will now copy all files into <a href="#_" id="user_dir2">the "macintosh.js" folder in your user directory</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>How can I mount disk images?</h2>

  <p>
    If you have files in the "iso" or "img" format, place them in the "macintosh.js" folder in your user directory. We will automatically mount them as virtual drives. There's a considerable performance hit for each mounted virtual drive and disk, so be careful.
  </p>

  <h2>Developer Tools</h2>

  <p>
    If you're curious, you can enable developer tools. They will automatically open when you start the app. Some transparency features
    will break. Restart the app for this change to take effect.
